        Struggling with technology?
        Get free website help from Patch the Web.
    </h1>

    <h2>Qualifications</h2>
    <p>
        I design free, simple websites for small businesses, nonprofits, and individuals that do not already have a website.
        I also offer free help to those who have a website already and meet <strong>one</strong> of the criteria below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have not received a website update in the last 5 years.</li>
        <li>Your website has major accessibility issues.</li>
        <li>Your website is not mobile-friendly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Priority is given to residents of Virginia; however, I will consider remote requests from other locations if I have time.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <h3>Registration</h3>
    <p>
        To get started, please fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/8b1d9Z2f3c7g5j4u6">Patch the Web form</a>.
        I will review your request and contact you to discuss your needs.
        If you are eligible, I will work with you to create a simple website.
        The process typically takes a few weeks, depending on the complexity of your needs and my availability.
    </p>
    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <p>
        Please prepare any content you want on your website, such as text, images, logos, and color schemes.
        If you are not sure what to put on your website, I can help fill in the gaps.
    </p>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
        After we discuss the content, I will create prototype for your website.
        The design will work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
        It will also be accessible to users with disabilities.
    </p>
    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>
        Before the website is published, we will review it and discuss any last-minute changes.
    </p>
    <h3>Launch</h3>
    <p>
        The website will be published on a free hosting service.
        I'll share the link with you, and I'll do my best to provide resources and support to help you maintain your website after it is live.
        However, I cannot guarantee ongoing support or maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy your new website!</p>
